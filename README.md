## 👋 About Me

I build **end-to-end data and AI systems** — from problem framing and system architecture
to model training, full-stack integration, and production-ready delivery.

My work focuses on:
- Applied Machine Learning & Generative AI (LLMs, RAG)
- Full-Stack Web Systems (Django, PostgreSQL)
- Decision Intelligence & Explainable AI
- Product Engineering for real-world problems (Education, Enterprise Ops, Manufacturing)

⚠️ *Some projects are shared as architecture, research, or design artifacts due to IP, confidentiality, or ongoing patent considerations.*
